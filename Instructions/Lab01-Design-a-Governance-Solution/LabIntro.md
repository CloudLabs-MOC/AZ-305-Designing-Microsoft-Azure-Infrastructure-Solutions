# Lab 01 - Design a Governance Solution
# Student lab manual
## Lab scenario

In order to improve management of Azure resources in Contoso, you have been tasked with implementing the following functionality:

- Management Groups in Azure to manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions. You can organize subscriptions into management groups and apply your governance policies to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the policies applied to the management group.

- Assign subscriptions to the management groups to separate billing environments, such as development, test, and production.

- Assign Policies to enforce different rules over your resource configurations so the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.
- Cost Analysis - Microsoft Cost Management is a suite of tools that help organizations monitor, allocate, and optimize the cost of their Microsoft Cloud workloads. 

## Objectives

In this lab, we will:

+ Task 1: Create Management Groups
+ Task 2: Create Child Management Groups
+ Task 3: Assign Subscriptions to management groups
+ Task 4: Assign Policies and Governance to management groups
+ Task 5: Review the cost data and explore the cost manager

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
