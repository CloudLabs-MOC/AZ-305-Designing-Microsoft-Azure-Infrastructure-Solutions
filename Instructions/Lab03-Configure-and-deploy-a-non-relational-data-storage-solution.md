# Lab 03 - Configure and deploy a non-relational data storage solution 
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

In order to improve management of Azure resources in Contoso, you have been tasked with implementing the following functionality:

- An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

- Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. You can use Blob Storage to gather or expose media, content, or application data to users.

- Assign Policies to enforce different rules over your resource configurations so the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.
- Cost Analysis - Microsoft Cost Management is a suite of tools that help organizations monitor, allocate, and optimize the cost of their Microsoft Cloud workloads. 

## Objectives

In this lab, we will:

+ Task 1: Create Management Groups
+ Task 2: Create Child Management Groups
+ Task 3: Assign Subscriptions to management groups
+ Task 4: Assign Policies and Governance to management groups
+ Task 5: Review the cost data and explore the cost manager

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
