# Lab 03 - Configure and deploy a non-relational data storage solution 
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

In order to improve management of Azure resources, you have been tasked with implementing the following functionality:

- Configure an Azure Storage account. An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

- Configure an Azure blob storage. Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. You can use Blob Storage to gather or expose media, content, or application data to users.

- Upload some files to the blob container and apply the lifecycle policy. Azure Storage lifecycle management offers a rule-based policy that you can use to transition blob data to the appropriate access tiers or to expire data at the end of the data lifecycle. A lifecycle policy acts on a base blob, and optionally on the blob's versions or snapshots.

- Configure a static website to aceess the blob container. You can serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files) directly from a storage container. Azure Storage static website hosting is a great option in cases where you don't require a web server to render content. 

- Secure blob storage and enable backup/soft delete. To secure your blob storage you can use access keys, shared access signatures. Blob soft delete protects an individual blob, snapshot, or version from accidental deletes or overwrites by maintaining the deleted data in the system for a specified period of time. During the retention period, you can restore a soft-deleted object to its state at the time it was deleted. After the retention period has expired, the object is permanently deleted.

- Configure Azure files. Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, Network File System (NFS) protocol, and Azure Files REST API. Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments. SMB Azure file shares are accessible from Windows, Linux, and macOS clients.

### Task 6: Secure blob storage and enable backup and soft delete

In this task, you will learn how to use the Azure portal to secure your blob storage and enable backup and soft delete.

#### Pre-requisites for this task

An Azure account, a storage account (Complete Task 1), an azure blob container (Complete Task 1 & Task 2 & Task3). Securing access to your Blob storage is a critical step for any Azure administrator or engineer. The following steps outline available security features to help you configure your Blob storage to be secured.

#### Steps

By default, storage accounts encrypt the data using Microsoft-managed keys. You can continue using these Microsoft-managed keys for data encryption, or you can manage encryption using your keys.

If you choose to use your own encryption keys, you have two options, and you can use either type of key management or both.

Use a customer-managed key. These keys must be stored in an Azure Key Vault.

Use a customer-provided key. These keys are used for Blob storage operations. A client who makes read or write requests against Blob storage can use an encryption key on the request. This method provides granular control over how blob data is encrypted and decrypted.

To configure a storage account to use a customer-managed key stored in a Key Vault:

1. If creating a new Key Vault, place the Key Vault in the same region as the storage account and enable purge protection. If you have an existing key vault, go to the Key Vaultâ€™s Settings, then choose Properties to enable purge protection.

    Create a Key Vault if you donâ€™t have an existing one available. Check out the following quickstart on creating a key vault using the Azure portal.

    1. Open Azure portal, in the Search box, enter Key Vault.
    
    2. From the results list, choose Key Vault.
    
    ![image](media/life6.png)
    
    3. On the Key Vault section, choose Create.

    ![image](media/life7.png)
    
    4. On the Create key vault section provide the following information:
        
       **Name: A unique name is required. For this quickstart, we use contoso-vault3.**
        
       **Subscription: Choose a subscription.**
        
       **Under Resource Group, select the previously created resource group.**
        
       **In the Location pull-down menu, choose a location (East US where your storage account located).**
        
       **Choose to enable purge protection.**
        
       **Leave the other options to their defaults.**
        
    ![image](media/life8.png)   
            
    5. After providing the information above, select Review + Create.

    ![image](media/life9.png)
    
    6. After the validation completed, please select Create.

    7. Once the deployment complete, please select Go to resource button.
   
   Take note of the two properties listed below:

   **Vault Name: In the example, this is contoso-vault3. You will use this name for other steps.**
      
   **Vault URI: In the example, this is https://contoso-vault3.vault.azure.net/. Applications that use your vault through its REST API must use this URI.**
      
    At this point, your Azure account is the only one authorized to perform operations on this new vault

3. In the storage account, navigate to Security + Networking, then choose Encryption.

4. For Encryption type, select the radio button for Customer-managed keys.

5. For the Key selection, ensure the Select from key vault value is selected, then choose the link for Select a key vault and key.

![image](media/life11.png)

6. In the Select a key page, select the subscription, key store type, and key vault to store the customer-managed encryption key. If you have an existing key stored in the key vault, select the key from the dropdown. Otherwise, select Create a new key

![image](media/life12.png)

7. On the Create a Key page, select Generate for the options dropdown list, enter name as contosostr345-key, keep the default settings as it is and please select Create button.

![image](media/life13.png)

8. In the Select a key window, ensure the newly created key is selected in the Key dropdown, then click Select.

![image](media/life14.png)

9. Back in the Encryption settings, click Save.

![image](media/life15.png)


#### To secure your blob storage you can configure Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

Shared access signatures work through a signed URI that includes a token and a set of query parameters. The token determines which resources the client can access. To create a shared access signature:

#### Steps to configure shared access signatures as follows:

1. Navigate to the storage account in the Azure portal.

2. In the storage account, navigate to Security + networking, then choose Shared access signature.

![image](media/life16.png)

3. In the Shared access signature pane, choose the storage account services and options the shared access signature should have. This example gives Read and List permissions to Blobs in a container. Always use the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to a SAS. Please select the options as per the below image

![image](media/life17.png)

4. Choose a start and end time for how long the SAS should be valid.

5. If needed, you can also limit what IP addresses can send requests to the storage account using the SAS.

6. As a best practice, only allow the HTTPS protocol when using the SAS URI.

7. Finally, choose which access key to sign the shared access signature. If you revoke the access key, any shared access signature created from the access key is invalidated.

8. Once you configured all the options, then select Generate SAS and connection string.

![image](media/life18.png)

9. The wizard produces three options for using the SAS: a connection string for applications, a SAS token, and a Blob service SAS URL.

![image](media/life19.png)

By providing the SAS, you can control what resources they have access to, what permissions they have on those resources, and how long they have access to the resources.

#### Enable backup and Soft delete

By enabling Soft delete you can protect your data from accidental deletion, from the following steps you can easily configure soft delete for your blob storage.

#### Steps

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your storage account which you created on previous task.

2. Locate the Data Protection option under Data management.

3. In the Recovery section, select Turn on soft delete for blobs.

![image](media/life20.png)

4. Specify a retention period between 1 and 365 days. Microsoft recommends a minimum retention period of seven days. In this example provide 7 days.
Save your changes.

#### Configure Backup for Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob backup is configured at the storage account level. As a result, operational backup protects all blobs in the storage account.

Using the Backup Center, you can configure backup for multiple storage accounts. You can also configure backup for a storage account using the Data Protection properties of the storage account. This section covers both methods for configuring backup.

Before Configuring backup, the storage account should have a Backup vault and Storage account backup contributor role.

#### To configure the Backup vault please follow below steps:

A backup vault is a management entity that stores recovery points that have been created over time and provides an interface for performing backup operations. These include on-demand backups, restores, and the creation of backup policies.

1. Type Backup vaults in the search box.

2. Under Services, select Backup vaults.

![image](media/bvault1.png)

3. On the Backup vaults page, select Add.

![image](media/bvault2.png)

4. Make sure the correct subscription is selected under Project details on the Basics tab, then select the resource group which you have created on the previous task.

5. Under Instance details, type myVault for the Backup vault name and choose your region of choice, in this case East US for your Region.

6. Now choose your Storage redundancy. Storage redundancy cannot be changed after protecting items to the vault. We recommend that if you're using Azure as a primary backup storage endpoint, continue to use the default Globally-redundant setting.

**Note : If you don't use Azure as a primary backup storage endpoint, choose Locally redundant, which reduces the Azure storage costs. Learn more about geo and local redundancy.**

![image](media/back5.png)

7. Please review the options and the values, and select Create button to create the backup vault.

![image](media/back6.png)
