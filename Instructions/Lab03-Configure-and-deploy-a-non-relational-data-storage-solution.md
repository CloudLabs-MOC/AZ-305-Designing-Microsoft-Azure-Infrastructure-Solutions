# Lab 03 - Configure and deploy a non-relational data storage solution 
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

In order to improve management of Azure resources in Contoso, you have been tasked with implementing the following functionality:

- An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

- Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. You can use Blob Storage to gather or expose media, content, or application data to users.

- Configure a static website to aceess the blob container
- Upload some files to the blob container and apply the lifecycle policy.
- Secure blob storage and enable backup/soft delete
- Configure Azure file  

## Objectives

In this lab, we will:

+ Task 1: Create Azure Storage account
+ Task 2: Configure Azure Blob storage
+ Task 3: Configure a static website to access the blob container and upload files to the blob container
+ Task 4: Upload files to the blob container and apply the lifecycle policy
+ Task 5: Secure blob storage and enable backup/soft delete
+ Task 6: Configure Azure file

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
