## Exercise 1: Create a secured hub and spoke network

In this exercise, you will use Azure Virtual Network Manager to create a hub and spoke network topology. The hub virtual network will then have a virtual network gateway installed to allow resources in the spoke virtual networks to communicate with remote networks via VPN. You'll also set up security to block outbound network traffic to the internet on ports 80 and 443. Finally, you'll check the virtual network and virtual machine settings to ensure that the configurations were applied correctly.

In this Exercise, you will have:

  + Task 1: Create virtual networks.
  + Task 2: Deploy a virtual network gateway.
  + Task 3: Create a dynamic network group.
  + Task 4: Create a hub and spoke connectivity configuration.
  + Task 5: Deploy the connectivity configuration.
  + Task 6: Create security configuration.
  + Task 7: Deploy the security admin configuration.
  + Task 8: Verify deployment of configurations.
